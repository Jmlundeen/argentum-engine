/**
 * A replacement effect that has been granted temporarily, anchored to an entity.
 *
 * Used for "this turn" replacement riders created by a resolving ability — e.g. Forgotten
 * Cellar ("if a card would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn, exile it
 * instead"), which grants a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.RedirectZoneChange] until end of
 * turn. Stored in [com.wingedsheep.engine.state.GameState.grantedReplacementEffects] and read
 * at the point of use — the zone-change redirect path consults granted
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.RedirectZoneChange] alongside permanents' printed replacement
 * effects.
 *
 * Mirrors [GrantedStaticAbility]: replacement effects are checked where they matter (zone
 * movement) rather than projected onto the entity via the layer system, so a GameState-keyed
 * record is the right channel.
 *
 * @property entityId The permanent the grant is anchored to (its controller scopes "you")
 * @property controllerId The player who controls the grant — used for owner/controller filters
 * @property replacement The replacement effect that was granted
 * @property duration How long the grant lasts
