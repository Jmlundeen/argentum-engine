/**
 * Regression net for the token-creation replacement batch (CR 614 — "those tokens plus an
 * additional Food token are created instead" applies once per token-creation event, regardless
 * of how many tokens the event makes; CR 614.5 — the added token is created directly and is
 * self-limiting, so it doesn't re-trigger the replacement).
 *
 * Guards the CreateTokenExecutor fix where applyAdditionalTokenReplacements was invoked twice for
 * a single custom CreateTokenEffect batch, so a multi-token creation added the extra Food *twice*.
 * Predefined-token creations (Food/Treasure/Map) route through CreatePredefinedTokenExecutor and
 * were unaffected — which is why a single-Treasure path like Worldwalker Helm stayed green even
 * with the bug. Only a custom multi-token CreateTokenEffect surfaces the regression, so that is
 * exactly what this exercises, with inline cards so it has no set dependency.
