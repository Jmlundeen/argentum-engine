/**
 * Scenario tests for Erg Raiders' end-step self-damage trigger.
 *
 * Oracle: "At the beginning of your end step, if this creature didn't attack this turn,
 * it deals 2 damage to you unless it came under your control this turn."
 *
 * Three cases:
 *  1. Settled (no attack, didn't enter this turn) → triggers, 2 damage to controller.
 *  2. Attacked this turn → doesn't trigger.
 *  3. Just entered (summoning-sick) → doesn't trigger.
