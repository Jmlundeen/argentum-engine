# LTR — Missing Effects

Auto-generated triage of the unimplemented LTR cards, **refreshed 2026-06-10**.
For each card we list every engine primitive / mechanic family it touches; the
leaderboard ranks each family by how many missing cards it appears on.

> ⚠️ The original generator (`scripts/ltr_categorize.py`) has been retired. This
> refresh was rebuilt from the prior per-card tags: the 9 cards implemented since
> the 2026-06-08 snapshot were dropped and counts recomputed. Card→family tags are
> still hand-curated; verify against `cards.md` + `ltr_set.json` when in doubt.

**Missing cards:** 82 of 291 (72% implemented)

## Foundational families now IMPLEMENTED (no longer blockers)

These primitives exist in the SDK/engine today (grep-confirmed) or need no engine
work, so a card tagged **only** with these is implementable now — it's waiting on
authoring, not on the engine. They are kept in the tables below (marked ✅) so the
historical tagging stays intact, but they do **not** count toward remaining work.

- ✅ Amass / Army tokens
- ✅ Basic lands (no engine work)
- ✅ Custom named counter types (verse / influence / burden)
- ✅ Food tokens
- ✅ Ring temptation mechanic
- ✅ Scry triggers + scry-driven effects
- ✅ Stun counters
- ✅ Treasure tokens
- ✅ trigger: opponent draws a card except first in their draw step

Cards implemented since the last snapshot (removed from the tables below): A-Orcish Bowmasters, Gríma Wormtongue, Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, Long List of the Ents, Nasty End, Orcish Bowmasters, Rise of the Witch-king, Samwise the Stouthearted, Scroll of Isildur, Shortcut to Mushrooms, There and Back Again.

## Effect-family leaderboard

Ranked by how many of the missing cards depend on each family. Families marked ✅
are already implemented (or need no engine work) and are **not** blockers — the
real remaining work is the unmarked rows.

## What unblocks the most cards (remaining engine gaps only)

Implemented families filtered out. This is the actionable ranking: build the top
row and you touch the most still-missing cards. (A card needs *all* its remaining
families before it ships, so high count ≠ instant completions — see the per-card map.)
