 * A pluggable engine that scores the cards in a draft pack and recommends which to take. The

 * later by implementing this interface and registering them in [AdvisorCatalog] — the server
 * endpoint and client UI never change.
 *
 * Operates on [CardSummary] so the same scoring serves both the human "Suggest Pick" button and the
 * AI bot's auto-pick (see [com.wingedsheep.ai.engine.LimitedPickScorer]).
