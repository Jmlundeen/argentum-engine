/**
 * Terrasymbiosis
 * {2}{G}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever you put one or more +1/+1 counters on a creature you control, you may draw
 * that many cards. Do this only once each turn.
 *
 * Implementation: `Triggers.PlusOneCountersPlacedOnYourCreature` (a `CountersPlacedEvent`
 * for `Counters.PLUS_ONE_PLUS_ONE` filtered to creatures you control) gives us the
 * trigger and exposes the placed count via `TRIGGER_COUNTERS_PLACED_AMOUNT`. The "may"
 * is `optional = true`, and the "do this only once each turn" gate uses the existing
 * `oncePerTurn = true` flag on `TriggeredAbility` (the same mechanism as Scavenger's
 * Talent).
